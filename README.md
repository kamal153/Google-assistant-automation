# IFTTT (If This Then That)

If This Then That, also known as IFTTT is a free web-based service to create chains of simple conditional statements, called applets. An applet is triggered by changes that occur within other web services such as Gmail, Facebook, Telegram, Instagram, or Pinterest. \
 \
For example, an applet may send an e-mail message if the user tweets using a hashtag or copy a photo on Facebook to a user's archive if someone tags a user in a photo.
